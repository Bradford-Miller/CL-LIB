The length of the output is the sum of the lengths of theinputs and is unbounded if either input is unbounded.  The order of theelements remains unchanged; however, the elements from the two inputs arestably intermixed under the control of the COMPARATOR.The COMPARATOR must accept two arguments and return non-null if and only ifits first argument is strictly less than its second argument (in someappropriate sense).  At each step, the COMPARATOR is used to compare thecurrent elements in the two series.  If the current element from ITEMS2 isstrictly less than the current element from ITEMS1, the current element isremoved from ITEMS2 and transferred to the output.  Otherwise, the nextoutput element comes from ITEMS1.(MINGLE #Z(1 3 7 9) #Z(4 5 8) #'<) => #Z(1 3 4 5 7 8 9) (MINGLE #Z(1 7 3 9) #Z(4 5 8) #'<) => #Z(1 4 5 7 3 8 9)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
