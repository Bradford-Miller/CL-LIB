                                                                   next-in    MACRONEXT-IN GENERATOR {ACTION}*                                         [Macro]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONNEXT-IN returns the next element in the generator GENERATOR.  The ACTIONScan be any Lisp expressions.  They are evaluated if and only if no moreelements can be retrieved from GENERATOR.  If there are no more elementsand no actions, it is an error.  It is also an error to apply NEXT-IN to agenerator a second time after the generator has run out of elements.  As anexample of generators, consider the following.(LET ((X (GENERATOR (SCAN '(1 2 3 4)))))   (WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING (S)     (LOOP (PRIN1 (NEXT-IN X (RETURN)) S)           (PRIN1 (NEXT-IN X (RETURN)) S)           (PRINC "," S))))  => "12,34,"     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
