                                                optimizable-series-function    Declaration SPECIFIEROPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION                         [Declaration specifier]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONThe declaration specifier (OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION INTEGER) indicatesthat the function being defined is a series function that needs to beanalyzed so that it can be optimized when it appears in series expressions.(A warning is issued if the function being defined neither takes a seriesas input nor produces a series as output.)  INTEGER (default 1) specifiesthe number of values returned by the function being defined.  (This cannotnecessarily be determined by local analysis.)  The only placeOPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION is allowed to appear is in a declarationimmediately inside a DEFUN.  As an example, the following shows how asimplified version of COLLECT-SUM could be defined.(DEFUN SIMPLE-COLLECT-SUM (NUMBERS)   (DECLARE (OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION 1))   (COLLECT-FN 'NUMBER #'(LAMBDA () 0) #'+ NUMBERS))     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     about-series-optimization;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
