The series input MONOTONIC-INDICESmust be a strictly increasing series of non-negative integers.  The output,which is always unbounded, contains T in the positions specified byMONOTONIC-INDICES and NIL everywhere else.(MASK #Z()) => #Z(NIL NIL ...) (MASK #Z(0 2 3)) => #Z(T NIL T T NIL NIL ...) (MASK (POSITIONS #Z(NIL A NIL B NIL))) => #Z(NIL T NIL T NIL ...)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     positions;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
