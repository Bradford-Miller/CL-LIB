                                                       series-element-type    Type SPECIFIERSERIES-ELEMENT-TYPE                                        [Type specifier]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONThe type specifier (SERIES-ELEMENT-TYPE VARIABLE) denotes the type ofelements in the series held in VARIABLE.  VARIABLE must be a variablecarrying a series value (for example, a series argument of a seriesfunction).  SERIES-ELEMENT-TYPE can only be used in three places: in adeclaration in a LET, MAPPING, PRODUCING, or other binding form in a seriesexpression; in a declaration in a DEFUN being used to define a seriesfunction; or in a type argument to a series function.  As an example,consider that COLLECT-LAST could have been defined as follows.  The use ofSERIES-ELEMENT-TYPE ensures that the internal variable keeping track of themost recent item has the correct type.(DEFUN COLLECT-LAST (ITEMS &OPTIONAL (DEFAULT NIL))   (DECLARE (OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION))   (COLLECT-FN '(SERIES-ELEMENT-TYPE ITEMS)               #'(LAMBDA () DEFAULT)               #'(LAMBDA (OLD NEW) NEW)               ITEMS))     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     about-series-optimization;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
