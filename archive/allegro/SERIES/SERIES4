TheTYPE argument is a type specifier indicating the type of sequence to bescanned; it must be a (not necessarily proper) subtype of SEQUENCE.  IfTYPE is omitted, it defaults to LIST.If the SEQUENCE is a list, it must be a proper list ending in NIL.Scanning is significantly more efficient if it can be determined at compiletime whether TYPE is a subtype of LIST or VECTOR and for vectors what thelength of the vector is.(SCAN '(A B C)) => #Z(A B C) (SCAN 'STRING "BAR") => #Z(#\B #\A #\R)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
