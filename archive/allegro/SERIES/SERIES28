                                                                     chunk    FUNCTIONCHUNK M N ITEMS                                                  [Function]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONThis function has the effect of breaking up the input series ITEMS into(possibly overlapping) chunks of length M.  The starting positions ofsuccessive chunks differ by N.  The inputs M and N must both be positiveintegers.CHUNK produces M output series.  The ith chunk consists of the ith elementsof the M outputs.  Suppose that the length of ITEMS is L.  The length ofeach output is the floor of 1+(L-M)/N.  The ith element of the kth outputis the (i*n+k)th element of ITEMS (i and k counting from zero).The first example below shows CHUNK being used to compute a moving average.The second example shows CHUNK being used to convert a property list intoan association list.(MAPPING (((XI XI+1 XI+2) (CHUNK 3 1 #Z(1 5 3 4 5 6))))    (/ (+ XI XI+1 XI+2) 3)) => #Z(3 4 4 5)(COLLECT   (MAPPING (((PROP VAL) (CHUNK 2 2 (SCAN '(A 2 B 5 C 8)))))     (CONS PROP VAL))) => ((A . 2) (B . 5) (C . 8))     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
