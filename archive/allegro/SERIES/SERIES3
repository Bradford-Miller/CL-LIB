The :TYPE argument (default NUMBER) is a typespecifier indicating the type of numbers in the series produced.  The :TYPEargument must be a (not necessarily proper) subtype of NUMBER.  The :STARTand :BY arguments must be of that type.One of the last five arguments may be used to specify the kind of end testto be used; these are called TERMINATION ARGUMENTS.  If :UPTO is specified,counting continues only so long as the numbers generated are less than orequal to :UPTO.  If :BELOW is specified, counting continues only so longas the numbers generated are less than :BELOW.  If :DOWNTO is specified,counting continues only so long as the numbers generated are greater thanor equal to :DOWNTO.  If :ABOVE is specified, counting continues only solong as the numbers generated are greater than :ABOVE.  If :LENGTH isspecified, it must be a non-negative integer and the output series has thislength.If none of the termination arguments are specified, the output hasunbounded length.  If more than one termination argument is specified, itis an error.(SCAN-RANGE :UPTO 4) => #Z(0 1 2 3 4) (SCAN-RANGE :FROM 1 :BY -1 :ABOVE -4) => #Z(1 0 -1 -2 -3) (SCAN-RANGE :FROM .5 :BY .1 :TYPE 'FLOAT) => #Z(.5 .6 .7 ...) (SCAN-RANGE) => #Z(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ...)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
