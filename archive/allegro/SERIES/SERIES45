                                                              off-line-port    Declaration SPECIFIEROFF-LINE-PORT                                       [Declaration specifier]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONThe declaration specifier (OFF-LINE-PORT PORT-SPEC1 PORT-SPEC2 ...)specifies that the indicated inputs and outputs are off-line.  Thisdeclaration specifier is only allowed in a DEFUN that contains thedeclaration OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION.  Each PORT-SPEC must either be asymbol that is one of the inputs of the function or an integer J indicatingthe jth output (counting from zero).  For example, (OFF-LINE-PORT X 1)indicates that the input X and the second output are off-line.  Every portthat is not mentioned in an OFF-LINE-PORT declaration is assumed to beon-line.  A warning is issued whenever a port's actual on-line/off-linestatus does not agree with its declared status.  This makes it easier tokeep track of which ports are off-line and which are not.  Note thatoff-line ports virtually never arise when defining scanners or reducers.     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     about-series-optimization;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
