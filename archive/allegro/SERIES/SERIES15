                                                                     iterate    MACROITERATE ({({VAR | ({VAR}*)} VALUE)}*) {DECLARATION}* {FORM}*        [Macro]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONThe form ITERATE is the same as MAPPING, except that after mapping theFORMS over the VALUES, the results are discarded and NIL is returned.(LET ((ITEM (SCAN '((1) (-2) (3)))))   (ITERATE ((X (#MCAR ITEM)))     (IF (PLUSP X) (PRIN1 X))))  => NIL (after printing ``13'')To a first approximation, ITERATE and MAPPING differ in the same way asMAPC and MAPCAR.  In particular, like MAPC, ITERATE is intended to be usedin situations where the FORMS are being evaluated for side effect ratherthan their results.  However, due to the lazy evaluation semantics ofseries, the difference between ITERATE and MAPPING is more than just aquestion of efficiency.If MAPCAR is used in a situation where the output is not used, time iswasted unnecessarily creating the output list.  However, if MAPPING is usedin a situation where the output is not used, no computation is performed,because series elements are not computed until they are used.  Thus ITERATEcan be thought of as a declaration that the indicated computation is to beperformed even though the output is not used for anything.     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     mapping map-fn;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
