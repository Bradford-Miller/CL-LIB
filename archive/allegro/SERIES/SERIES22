If there are N test inputs following ITEMS, thenthere are N+1 outputs.  Each input element is placed in exactly one outputseries, depending on the outcome of a sequence of tests.  If the elementITEMS[j] fails the first K-1 tests and passes the kth test, it is put inthe kth output.  If ITEMS[j] fails every test, it is placed in the lastoutput.  In addition, all output stops as soon as any series input runs outof elements.  The test inputs to SPLIT are series of values; ITEMS[j]passes the kth test if the jth element of the kth test-series is not NIL.The test inputs to SPLIT-IF are predicates; ITEMS[j] passes the kth test ifthe kth test predicate returns non-null when applied to ITEMS[j].(SPLIT #Z(-1 2 3 -4) #Z(T NIL NIL T)) => #Z(-1 -4) and #Z(2 3) (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (+X -X) (SPLIT-IF  #Z(-1 2 3 -4) #'PLUSP)   (VALUES (COLLECT-SUM +X) (COLLECT-SUM -X)))  => 5 and -5     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
