Following the order of the input, each KEYS[j]/VALUES[j]pair is entered into the output so that it overrides all earlierassociations.  If one of the input series is longer than the other, theextra elements are ignored.  The keyword arguments of COLLECT-HASH specifyattributes of the hash table produced and have the same meanings as thearguments to MAKE-HASH-TABLE.(COLLECT-ALIST #Z(A B C) #Z(1 2)) => ((B . 2) (A . 1)) (COLLECT-HASH #Z() #Z(1 2) :TEST #'EQ) => <an empty hash table>     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
