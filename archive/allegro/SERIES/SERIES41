                                                                      alter    FUNCTIONALTER DESTINATIONS ITEMS                                         [Function]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONALTER changes the series DESTINATIONS so that it contains the elements inthe series ITEMS.  More importantly, in the manner of SETF, the datastructure that underlies DESTINATIONS is changed so that if the seriesDESTINATIONS were to be regenerated, the new values would be obtained.  Thealteration process stops as soon as either input runs out of elements.  Thevalue NIL is always returned. In the example below each negative element ina list is replaced with its square.(LET* ((DATA (LIST 1 -2 3 4 -5 6))        (X (CHOOSE-IF #'MINUSP (SCAN DATA))))   (ALTER X (#M* X X))   DATA)  => (1 4 3 4 25 6)ALTER can only be applied to series that are ALTERABLE.  SCAN,SCAN-ALIST, SCAN-MULTIPLE, SCAN-PLIST, and SCAN-LISTS-OF-LISTS-FRINGEproduce alterable series.  However, the alterability of the output ofSCAN-LISTS-OF-LISTS-FRINGE is incomplete.  If SCAN-LISTS-OF-LISTS-FRINGE isapplied to an object that is a leaf, altering the output series does notchange the object.In general, the output of a transducer is alterable as long as the elementsof the output come directly from the elements of an input that isalterable.  In particular, the outputs of CHOOSE, CHOOSE-IF, SPLIT,SPLIT-IF, COTRUNCATE, UNTIL, UNTIL-IF, and SUBSERIES are alterable as longas the corresponding inputs are alterable.     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
