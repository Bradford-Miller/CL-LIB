                                                                    to-alter    FUNCTIONTO-ALTER ITEMS ALTER-FN &rest ARGS                               [Function]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONGiven a series ITEMS, TO-ALTER returns an alterable series A containingthe same elements.  The argument ALTER-FN is a function.  The remainingarguments are all series.  Let these series be S1, ..., SN.  If there are Narguments after ALTER-FN, ALTER-FN must accept N+1 inputs.  If (ALTER A B)is later encountered, (MAP-FN T ALTER-FN B S1 ... SN) is implicitlyevaluated.  For each element in B, ALTER-FN should make appropriate changesin the data structure underlying A.As an example, consider the following definition of a series function thatscans the elements of a list.  Alteration is performed by changing conscells in the list being scanned.(DEFUN SCAN-LIST (LIST)   (DECLARE (OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION))   (LET ((SUBLISTS (SCAN-SUBLISTS LIST)))     (TO-ALTER (#MCAR SUBLISTS)               #'(LAMBDA (NEW PARENT) (SETF (CAR PARENT) NEW))               SUBLISTS)))     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
