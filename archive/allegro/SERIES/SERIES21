The output contains the elements ofthe input series ITEMS spread out into the positions specified by thenon-null elements in BOOLS---that is, ITEMS[j] is in the position occupiedby the jth non-null element in BOOLS.  The other positions in the outputare occupied by DEFAULT.  The output stops as soon as BOOLS runs out ofelements or a non-null element in BOOLS is encountered for which there isno corresponding element in ITEMS.(EXPAND #Z(NIL T NIL T T) #Z(A B C)) => #Z(NIL A NIL B C) (EXPAND #Z(NIL T NIL T T) #Z(A)) => #Z(NIL A NIL)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     choose;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
