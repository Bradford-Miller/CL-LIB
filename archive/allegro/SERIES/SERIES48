As with the form GO,TERMINATE-PRODUCING does not return any values; rather, control immediatelyleaves the current context.  The form TERMINATE-PRODUCING is allowed toappear only in a PRODUCING body and causes the termination of the enclosingcall on PRODUCING.     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     producing;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
