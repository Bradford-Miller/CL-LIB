                                                                     latch    FUNCTIONLATCH ITEMS &key :AFTER :BEFORE :PRE :POST                       [Function]    Package    series    DESCRIPTIONThe series returned by LATCH is the same as the input series ITEMS exceptthat some of the elements are replaced by other values.  LATCH acts like aLATCH electronic circuit component.  Each input element causes the creationof a corresponding output element.  After a specified number of non-nullinput elements have been encountered, the latch is triggered and the outputmode is permanently changed.The :AFTER and :BEFORE arguments specify the latch point.  The latch pointis just after the :AFTER-th non-null element in ITEMS or just before the:BEFORE-th non-null element.  If neither :AFTER nor :BEFORE is specified,an :AFTER of 1 is assumed.  If both are specified, it is an error.If a :PRE is specified, every element prior to the latch point is replacedby this value.  If a :POST is specified, every element after the latchpoint is replaced by this value.  If neither is specified, a :POST of NILis assumed.(LATCH #Z(NIL C NIL D E)) => #Z(NIL C NIL NIL NIL) (LATCH #Z(NIL C NIL D E) :BEFORE 2 :POST T) => #Z(NIL C NIL T T)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
