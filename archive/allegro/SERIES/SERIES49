(The corresponding element of INPUTis the one most recently read at the moment when the output element iswritten.)  This declaration can only appear in a call on PRODUCING.  INPUTand OUTPUT must be an input and an output of the PRODUCING.  The examplebelow shows how the propagation of alterability could be supported in asimplified version of UNTIL.(DEFUN SIMPLE-UNTIL (BOOLS ITEMS)   (DECLARE (OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION))   (PRODUCING (Z) ((X BOOLS) (Y ITEMS) BOOL ITEM)     (DECLARE (PROPAGATE-ALTERABILITY Y Z))     (LOOP       (TAGBODY         (SETQ BOOL (NEXT-IN X (TERMINATE-PRODUCING)))         (SETQ ITEM (NEXT-IN Y (TERMINATE-PRODUCING)))         (IF BOOL (TERMINATE-PRODUCING))         (NEXT-OUT Z ITEM)))))     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     producing;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
