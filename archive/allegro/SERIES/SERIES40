It is identical to COLLECTING-FN except that it only returnsthe last element of each series computed.  If there are no elements inthese series, the values returned by INIT are passed on directly as theoutput of COLLECT-FN.(COLLECT-FN 'INTEGER #'(LAMBDA () 0) #'+ #Z(1 2 3)) => 6 (COLLECT-FN 'INTEGER #'(LAMBDA () 0) #'+ #Z()) => 0     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
