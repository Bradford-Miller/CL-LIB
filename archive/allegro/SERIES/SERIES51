Agenerator can produce a potentially unbounded number of elements of anytype.  Individual elements are not computed until requested by NEXT-IN.When an element is taken from a generator, it is removed by side effect.Subsequent uses of NEXT-IN obtain later elements.There is a close relationship between a generator and a series of theelements it produces.  In particular, any series can be converted into agenerator.  As a result, all the scanner functions used for creating seriescan be used to create generators as well.  There is no need to have aseparate set of functions for creating generators.Gatherers are generalized output streams.  Elements of any type can beentered into a gatherer using NEXT-OUT.  The gatherer combines the elementstogether in time-sequence order into a net result.  This result can beretrieved using RESULT-OF.There is a close relationship between a gatherer and a collector functionthat combines elements in the same way.  In particular, any one-inputone-output collector can be converted into a gatherer.  As a result, allthe collectors used for computing summary results from series can be usedto create gatherers.  There is no need to have a separate set of functionsfor creating gatherers.                              GeneratorsGENERATOR SERIES                                                 [Function]Given a series, GENERATOR returns a generator containing the same elements.     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators     next-in     gatherer     next-out;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
