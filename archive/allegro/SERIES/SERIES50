For example, there is no way to specify a cleanupexpression that will always be run, even when an abort occurs, withoutusing UNWIND-PROTECT.  ENCAPSULATED makes it possible to take advantage offorms such as UNWIND-PROTECT when defining a series function.ENCAPSULATED specifies a function that places an encapsulating form aroundthe computation performed by its second argument.  The first argument mustbe a quoted function that takes a Lisp expression and wraps the appropriateencapsulating form around it, returning the resulting code.  The secondinput must be a literal call on SCAN-FN, SCAN-FN-INCLUSIVE, or COLLECT-FN.The second argument can count on being evaluated in the scope of theencapsulating form.  The values returned by the second argument arereturned as the values of ENCAPSULATED.  The following shows howENCAPSULATED could be used to define a simplified version of COLLECT-FILE.(DEFUN COLLECT-FILE-WRAP (FILE NAME BODY)   `(WITH-OPEN-FILE (,FILE ,NAME :DIRECTION :OUTPUT) ,BODY)) (DEFMACRO SIMPLE-COLLECT-FILE (NAME ITEMS)   (LET ((FILE (GENSYM)))     `(ENCAPSULATED #'(LAMBDA (BODY)                        (COLLECT-FILE-WRAP ',FILE ',NAME BODY))                    (COLLECT-FN T #'(LAMBDA () T)                                #'(LAMBDA (STATE ITEM)                                    (PRINT ITEM ,FILE)                                    STATE)                                ,ITEMS))))     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
