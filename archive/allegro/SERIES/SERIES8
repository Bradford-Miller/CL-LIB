Each key in the inputappears exactly once in the output, even if it appears more than once inthe input.  (The TEST argument of SCAN-ALIST specifies the equality testbetween keys; it defaults to EQL.)  The two outputs have the same length.Each V[j] is the value returned by the appropriate accessing function(CDR-of-ASSOC, GETF, or GETHASH, respectively) when given K[j].  SCAN-ALISTand SCAN-PLIST scan keys in the order they appear in the underlyingstructure.  SCAN-HASH scans keys in no particular order.(SCAN-PLIST '(A 1 B 3)) => #Z(A B) AND #Z(1 3) (SCAN-ALIST '((A . 1) NIL (A . 3) (B . 2)))  => #Z(A B) AND #Z(1 2)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
