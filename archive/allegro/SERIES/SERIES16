Let K be thelength of the shortest input SI.  COTRUNCATE truncates the series so thateach output has length K.  Let K' be the position of the first element inthe boolean series BOOLS that is not NIL or, if every element is NIL, thelength of BOOLS.  UNTIL truncates the series so that each output has length(MIN K K').  Let K'' be the position of the first element in S1 such that(PRED S1[K'']) is not NIL or, if there is no such element, the length ofS1.  UNTIL-IF truncates the series so that each output has length (MIN K K'').(COTRUNCATE #Z(1 2 -3 4) #Z(A B C)) => #Z(1 2 -3) and #Z(A B C) (UNTIL #Z(NIL NIL T NIL) #Z(1 2 -3 4) #Z(A B C)) => #Z(1 2) and #Z(A B) (UNTIL-IF #'MINUSP #Z(1 2 -3 4) #Z(A B C)) => #Z(1 2) and #Z(A B)     SEE ALSO     about-series     about-generators;Copyright 1989 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,;Cambridge, Massachusetts.;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its;documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,;provided that this copyright and permission notice appear in all;copies and supporting documentation, and that the name of M.I.T. not;be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the;software without specific, written prior permission.
