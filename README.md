# CL-LIB
A classical set of Common Lisp functions and packages, for the most part inspired by functionality available on the Lisp Machines

## Consider this a "coming soon" announcement.
I am currently separating the contributions into loadable ASDF systems, while implementing FiveAM tests for some of the packages I wrote and porting the whole library to run on SBCL. 
After that I will upload the newest version here. An older version, suitable for LispWorks (as well as MCL, Symbolics and Explorer machines and possibly even Allegro) can be downloaded immediately from https://sites.google.com/site/bradfordwmiller/software but please be aware I will not be able to maintain that version unless the problem persists into the version to be posted here.
