<blockquote>The motivation for this package, initially, was the lack of a distiguished *error-output* in LispWorks, 
that is, unlike allegro, access to file descriptor 2 was not available, and so programs that are intended 
to be pipes have no place to put an error, other than a file.

This package allows one to create a stream into a popup console window and bind *error-output* or pretty much 
anything else to it.

How to use:
First, call (create-console). By default, a read-only console is created, suitable for displaying errors 
  as your program prints them, (create-console :rw) will put up an editor buffer (read/write). 
  In either case, a console object is returned, which is needed for the following calls. Optionally, you can
  specify a second argument, which will be the title of the window.

(console-stream console) returns a stream associated with a console, e.g., the thing to format to.

(format-console console format-string &rest args) is format for a console.

(read-line-console console &optional eof-error-p eof-value) is read-line for a console, but the console 
    argument is required.</blockquote>
